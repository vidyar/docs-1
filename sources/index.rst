Overview
=========

Shippable is a SaaS platform that lets you easily add Continuous Integration/Deployment to your Github and Bitbucket(Git) repositories. It is lightweight, super simple to setup, and runs your builds and tests faster than any other service. After building and testing your code, you can deploy it to any PaaS provider like Heroku & OpenShift and also to VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, or any major infrastructure provider.

Shippable uses **Build Minions** - i.e. docker based containers - to run your workloads. Docker is the fastest growing linux container solution and this will light up some cool scenarios like portability and versioning in the coming weeks.

Common use cases for Shippable include:

- Automating the packaging and deployment of web applications
- Automated testing and continuous integration/deployment

.. note:: **Shippable is 100% free to use, even for private repositories.**

We currently support the following languages - 

* Ruby
* Python
* Node.js
* Java
* Scala
* PHP 
* Go

Your Minions can test your repos on -

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 13.10 

We support the following services natively -

* MySQL
* Postgres

* Redis 
* MongoDB
